    without using Gurobi. 

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_file : str
        Path to an existing input file describing the instance to be solved.
        The format follows the specification provided for the assignment.
    
    output_file : str
        Path to the location where the solution file will be written.
        The function will create or overwrite this file with the computed solution.

    Returns
    -------
    None
        The function writes the solution to `output_file`. No value is returned.
