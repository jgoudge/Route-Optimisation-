Route Optimization for the PizzaBot

With its new PizzaBot 3000, the rising start-up DeliverBeaver Inc.
revolutionized the online food delivery market. These little four-wheeled
robots ensure swift and seamless delivery of delicious dishes from your
favorite restaurant right to your doorstep. However, as these sophisticated
machines are still expensive, their efficient usage is a top priority for the
company. Therefore, DeliverBeaver hired you to implement an algorithmic
solution for optimizing the order allocation and routing of the PizzaBots.
